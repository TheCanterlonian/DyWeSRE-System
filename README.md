Dynamic Web Server Redirection Entryway System

A collection of smaller systems working together to create an affordable solution to web hosting that allows home users to host websites from behind dynamically addressed internet access services.

By default the system described would use a web request of this page: checkip.dyndns.org/

The rate limit at current writing for this service is 300 requests per minute or 5 requests per second as listed here: https://help.dyn.com/managed-dns-api-rate-limit/

The system is intended to at most update every second and at least every hour so this limit is well within the intended accessing rate performed by the system.
